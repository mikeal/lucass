There are a bunch of content addressable stores out there, and even some abstract store specs. A few things that are different about lucass:

* There is **NO** requirement that implementations use a specific hashing method, only that the method they use is consistent.
  * This means that there can be many more types of implementations but that they aren't compatible by default. Users of each implementation may need to configure the hashing methods.
* Requires support for both Buffers and Streams as values.

This module contains compliance tests and two reference implementations (filesystem and inmemory).

## Spec

```javascript
class Store {
  set (value, cb) {
    // value is either a Buffer or a Stream, both must be supported.
    // cb(Error, Hash)
    // Hash must be consistent. Data written with Buffer or Stream should
    // be identical.
    // Hash must be a String.
  }
  getBuffer (hash, cb) {
    // Hash must be a String.
    // cb(Error, Buffer)
  }
  getStream (hash) {
    // Returns a stream.
    // If hash is not found in store emit an error.
    // All stored hashes must be accessible as Buffer or Stream.
  }
  hash (value, cb) {
    // Identical method signature to set but MUST NOT store the value.
  }
}
```

There are also optional APIs. These are not required as they may not be
possible on top of certain storage but *may* be required by certain users
of an implementation.

```javascript
class Store {
  set (value, ...args, cb) {
    // Optional args are sent to the hashing function..
  }
  hash (value, ...args, cb) {
    // Optional args are sent to the hashing function.
  }
}
```

## In-Memory Implementation

```javascript
let store = require('lucass/inmemory')()
store.set(Buffer.from('asdf'), (err, hash) => {
  store.getBuffer(hash, (err, value) => {
    console.log(value.toString) // 'asdf'
  })
})
```

Additionally, all methods in the spec are implemented.

## Filesystem Implementation

```javascript
let store = require('lucass/fs')('/var/custom-directory')
store.set(Buffer.from('asdf'), (err, hash) => {
  store.getBuffer(hash, (err, value) => {
    console.log(value.toString) // 'asdf'
  })
})
```

Additionally, all methods in the spec are implemented.
